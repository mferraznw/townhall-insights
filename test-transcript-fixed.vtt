00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
James Robinson – Operations Director: Welcome everyone, today we're focusing on how AI is improving demand forecasting and supply chain optimization across our APAC operations.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Sarah Chen – Regional Manager: Thank you James. We've seen significant improvements in our forecasting accuracy, up 23% since implementing the new AI models.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
James Robinson – Operations Director: That's excellent Sarah. Can you share more details about the specific challenges we've overcome?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Sarah Chen – Regional Manager: Absolutely. The main challenge was integrating real-time data from multiple sources. Our AI system now processes weather data, social media sentiment, and economic indicators to predict demand spikes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Michael Park – Supply Chain Lead: I'd like to add that we've also implemented predictive maintenance for our manufacturing equipment, reducing downtime by 15%.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
James Robinson – Operations Director: Outstanding results Michael. What about the cost implications of these AI investments?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Sarah Chen – Regional Manager: The ROI has been impressive. We've seen a 18% reduction in inventory costs while maintaining 99.2% service levels.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Michael Park – Supply Chain Lead: Additionally, our carbon footprint has decreased by 12% through optimized routing and reduced waste.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
James Robinson – Operations Director: These are exactly the kind of results we need to see. What's next on the roadmap?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Sarah Chen – Regional Manager: We're planning to expand AI integration to customer service, using chatbots and sentiment analysis to improve response times.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Michael Park – Supply Chain Lead: We're also exploring blockchain integration for supply chain transparency and automated contract management.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
James Robinson – Operations Director: Excellent vision. Let's continue this momentum and schedule our next review for Q4.
